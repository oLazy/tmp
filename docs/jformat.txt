Magnetotelluric data file J-format: 

A.G. Jones; 5 October 1994

version: 2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A file of MT data responses consists of a COMMENT BLOCK, followed by an
INFORMATION BLOCK, followed by one or more DATA BLOCKs for that site.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT BLOCK:
==============

At the beginning of a data file, as many comment lines as required can be
written. Each line must begin with the hash (#) mark. None of this information
is required or read by the reading routine.

Example:-

# MT & GDS estimates from LIMS codes version: v3.1
#
# Site info: Phoenix site 401    
# Ex length:  133
# Ey length:  135
# Ex azimuth:  12 True North
# Ey azimuth:  102 True North
# Hx azimuth:  12 True North
# Coherence minimum:   0.650000
# Coherence maximum:   0.990000
# Maxtype:JKN
# Ntype:  1
# Weight: Y
#


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFORMATION BLOCK:
==================

This block contains information about the site co-ordinates and site 
orientation. Each line must begin with a"greater-than" (>) sign, followed
by a recognizes keyword. After the keyword must be an equals (=) sign,
followed by the numeric value.

The following keywords are currently supported:-

AZIMUTH               the orientation of the "X"-direction of the responses
LATITUDE              site latitude  in degrees and decimals
LONGITUDE             site longitude in degrees and decimals
ELEVATION             site elevation in metres


Example:-

>AZIMUTH   =        45.0
>LATITUDE  =     57.7517
>LONGITUDE =   -103.9600
>ELEVATION =         0.0

DATA BLOCK:

The data block follows the comment and information blocks. The data block
contains the site responses in a variety of formats (either apparent 
resistivities and phases, or impedances - if impedances then units must be
specified).


MT data responses are stored in the following format:


RECORD     ENTRY        FORMAT    DESCRIPTION

Record   1:XXX001         A6      6 alphanumeric STATION NAME (case insensitive)
                                    survey XXX, station 001
                          
Record   2:RXY            A3      3 alphanumeric DATA TYPE (case insensitive)

                                  1st character must be:
                                  R - apparent resistivities and phases
                                  S - as "R" but upward-biased estimates
                                  Z - impedances
                                  Q - as "Z" but upward biased estimates
                                  C - "Z" expressed as Schmucker C function
                                  T - GDS transfer functions

                                  2nd/3rd characters can be
                                  XX - xx MT impedance element
                                  XY - xy MT impedance element
                                  YX - yx MT impedance element
                                  YY - yy MT impedance element
                                  TE - TE MT impedance element
                                  TM - TM MT impedance element
                                  AV - Berdichevsky average
                                  DE - determinant average
                                  ZX - Tzx transfer function
                                  ZY - Tzy transfer function
                                  Convention:
                                  The convention used is for RXY to represent
                                  the E-polarization (TE) mode, and for RYX
                                  to represent the B-polarization mode.

If the data are stored as impedances, then the units must be specified 
following the data type code. The two keywords are either "SI", for units
of ohms, or "field", for units of mV/km/nT. The preferred usage is ohms.
The following two examples are permitted:-
ZXX SI units (ohms)
ZXX field units (mV/km/nT)
Only the keywords "SI" and "field" are used. The other words are for 
clarification and confirmation.


Record   3: n            1I(free) number of points to follow

For data type=R??        9F(free)
Record   4: period(1), rho, pha, rhomax, rhomin, phamax, phamin, wrho, wpha
.        . 
Record 4+n: period(n), rho, pha, rhomax, rhomin, phamax, phamin, wrho, wpha

            period: period in s, if negative then is frequency in Hz
            rho   : apparent resistivity, if negative then rejected
            pha   : phase in degrees
            rhomax: rho + 1 standard error
            rhomin: rho - 1 standard error
            phamax: pha + 1 standard error
            phamin: pha - 1 standard error
            wrho  : weight for rho, if <0 then rejected
            wpha  : weight for phase
            -999. : missing data marker

The GSC responses are stored after the above in the following format:

Record   4: period(1), real, imag, error, weight
.        . 
Record 4+n: period(n), real, imag, error, weight

            period: period in s, if negative then is frequency in Hz
            real  : real part of the transfer function
            imag  : imaginary part of the transfer function
            error : standard error
            weight: weight (Note: some weights are in error!)
            -999. : missing data marker

Record 4+n+1: Repeat of 2 - 4+n for a different type from the same station
              Note: each type can have differing "n", but for MTREAD to
              construct RAV and RDE correctly, there must be the same
              number of periods in the same order for each of the two or
              four types respectively.
